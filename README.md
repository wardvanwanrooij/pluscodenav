# PlusCodeNav

## Overview

PlusCodeNav is a Connect IQ application for Garmin touch-based Bike Computers and Outdoor Handhelds. This application allows you to easily navigate to relative Plus Codes/Open Location Codes. The primary use case is to quickly navigate to (for example) a nearby restaurant. In Google Maps, select the restaurant, read the Plus Code (for example P823+G6), enter this code in PlusCodeNav and you can start the navigation.
This is also particularly useful when cycling in countries that have their own character set (e.g. Japan, South-Korea, Thailand), as entering a street address in Garmin can be a challenge, so instead entering a short code is preferred. All Plus Codes in Google Maps are relative (the first four characters are omitted) and this means that navigation is only possible to destinations within 30-50 kilometers (as the crow flies). The exact limit is determined based on your GPS location and presented before you can enter your Plus Code.
